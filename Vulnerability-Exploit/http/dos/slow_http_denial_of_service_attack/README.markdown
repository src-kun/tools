######TORS HAMMER TUTORIAL  
----------------------------------------------------
```bash
python torshammer.py
```
You should now see a terminal-based GUI interface.
Tor'shammer interface has it's own basic help menu that tells you how to run the script according to your target.
They already provide an example, but I will provide you another example simply for the context,
```bash
python torshammer.py -t 192.168.1.100 -r 100000 -T
```
the larger the thread count, the more efficient and effective the attack
will be. -T adds the Tor function which provides security, as well, as providing a new identity in case the site is
programmed to ban IP addresses which leave an open connection for "x" amount of time. Tor'shammer's method of
combining this is clever and effective, making it the powerful tool it is. However, Tor'shammer is only effective to
apache servers which do not run nginx.
